AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) is a web application that aims to connect gym-goers across a shared platform. The initial goal was to provide a space to create and join gym sessions at user-designated locations. The following are the current features of the application:

- Unique profiles
- Create sessions
- Join sessions
- Delete sessions
- Edit sessions
- Choose a location based on Google Maps
- Navigate to a location
- View a session feed

This project utilizes the following technologies and more:

- Next.js: Provides the main structure and organization using Next.js specific functions such as the app routing system and client/server-side rendering.
- Prisma: Simplifies the querying and creation of data by establishing schemas. Displays records in Prisma studio.
